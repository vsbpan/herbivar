Description: This package makes available several methods used for analyzing variability in 
    ecological data. Currently, it supports fitting a neutral herbivory model to data using 
    Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). IIt also contains several helper functions for comparing 
    distributions and assessing model fit. In addition, using the 'imager' infrastructure, 
    the package also supports automatic processing of leaf images, mostly in the context of leaf 
    scans, that can retrieve rich within-leaf herbivory data. The package is integrated with 
    the 'spatstat' packages that allows for spatial analysis of these data.
