Description: This package makes available several methods used for analyzing variability in 
    ecological data. Currently, it supports fitting a neutral herbivory model to data using 
    Maximum Likelihood (ML). It also contains several helper functions for investigating 
    distributions and wrangling the HerbVar dataset. In addition, using the 'imager' infrastructure, 
    the package also supports automatic processing of leaf images, mostly in the context of leaf 
    scans, that can retreive rich within leaf herbivory data. The package is integrated with 
    the 'spatstat' package that allows for spatial analysis of these data.
