\title{Compute nearest neighbor distance and perform Clark-Evans test}
\usage{
nn_dist(
  object,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "clustered", "regular", "greater", "lesser"),
  silent = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a matrix with two columns (x and y coordinates) or a 'split_herb' object}

\item{alternative}{the alternative hypothesis}

\item{silent}{If \code{TRUE}, the result of the test is not printed}
}
\value{
If \code{silent = TRUE}, the nearest neighbor distances are returned along with the result of the Clark-Evans test. If \code{silent = TRUE}, only the nearest neighbor distances are returned.
}
